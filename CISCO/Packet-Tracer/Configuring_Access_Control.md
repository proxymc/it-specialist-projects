# Packet Tracer - Configure Access Control

## 📌Overview

Authentication and authorization are distinct security processes in identity and access management (IAM). Authentication confirms a user's identity using passwords and other identification methods, while authorization assigns user permissions to resources.
In this Packet Tracer activity, authentication and authorization will be configured for network services including wireless network access, email, and FTP services.

### Objectives

- **Part 1:** Configure and Use AAA Authentication Credentials
- **Part 2:** Configure and Use Email Services
- **Part 3:** Configure and Use FTP Services

2. Enter:
   ```bash
   ftp 192.168.75.2
   ```
3. Authenticate with:
   ```bash
   Username: sukyi
   Password: cisco123
   ```
4. Enter `dir` to list files on the FTP server.
5. Download `aMessage.txt`:
   ```bash
   get aMessage.txt
   ```
6. Quit the FTP session, then open `Text Editor` and view the file.

   **File contents:**
   ```
   Greetings. You have successfully accessed the FTP server.
   ```
7. Create a new file, type a message, and save it as `aMessage_new.txt`.
8. Reconnect to the FTP server and upload the file:
   ```bash
   put aMessage_new.txt
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify FTP user privileges

1. Log into the FTP server from **HQ-Laptop-1** with `malia` credentials:
   ```bash
   ftp 192.168.75.2
   ```
2. Attempt to delete `aMessage_new.txt`:
   ```bash
   delete aMessage_new.txt
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** Malia cannot delete the file due to insufficient permissions.

3. Attempt to rename the file:
   ```bash
   rename aMessage_new.txt aMessage_rename.txt
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** Malia can rename the file since renaming is permitted.

4. Quit the FTP session.
